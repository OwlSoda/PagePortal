## 2024-05-22 - Missing Password Visibility Toggle
**Learning:** Users often struggle with password entry on mobile devices due to small keyboards. A "Show Password" toggle is a critical micro-UX feature that prevents login frustration but is often overlooked in initial implementations.
**Action:** When auditing auth flows, always check for the presence of a password visibility toggle. Use `VisualTransformation` and `trailingIcon` in Jetpack Compose to implement this standard pattern.

## 2024-05-23 - Emoji vs. Semantic Icons
**Learning:** Using emojis for status indicators (like "📖" or "🎧") is visually compact but accessible poorly. Screen readers announce them literally ("Open book"), missing the context.
**Action:** Replace status emojis with `Icon` composables using explicit `contentDescription`s (e.g., "Ebook available"). This improves accessibility while maintaining the same visual footprint.

## 2024-05-24 - Slider Precision Controls
**Learning:** Touch sliders are often imprecise, making it difficult for users to select specific values (like an exact font size). Adding incremental +/- buttons alongside the slider significantly improves usability and accessibility for fine-tuning.
**Action:** When using `Slider` for precise adjustments, always consider wrapping it in a `Row` with decrement/increment buttons. Ensure these buttons have proper `contentDescription` and `enabled` states based on the slider's range to prevent crashes or invalid states.

## 2026-02-02 - Component Parameter Types
**Learning:** Shared UI components like `EmptyState` that accept `String` for icons often lead to inconsistent usage (emojis vs text) and poor accessibility. Enforcing `ImageVector` types at the component level prevents this pattern and ensures consistent iconography across the app.
**Action:** When auditing shared components, refactor string-based icon parameters to strong-typed `ImageVector` or `Painter` parameters to enforce design system consistency.
